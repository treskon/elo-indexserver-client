class MapDomain:
    """This class contains the information of a map domain.
    A map is a set of key value pairs and can be addressed by a map
     domain name and a map ID. All maps with the same domain name are stored in the same database tables. These maps are
     distinguished by their ID, which can be an arbitary string. A map can be attached to a Sord object by setting the
    map
     ID to the Sord ID. Attached maps are deleted, when the Sord object is finally deleted. Furthermore they can be
    copied
     with the Sord object.

        Attributes:
            name (Union[Unset, str]): Map domain name. This can be a user definined name or one of the predefined names in
                MapDomainC.
                The value is
                 internally used as part of a database table name. Thus only alphanumeric characters are allowed.
            copy (Union[Unset, bool]): This value is true, if the map items should be copied when the associated Sord object
                is copied.
            replicate (Union[Unset, bool]): This value is true, if the map items should be replicated with the associated
                Sord object.
            history (Union[Unset, bool]): This value is true, if a history should be maintained for map items.
                A history is always available for
                 {@link MapDomainC#DOMAIN_SORD} and {@link MapDomainC#DOMAIN_WORKFLOW_ACTIVE}.
